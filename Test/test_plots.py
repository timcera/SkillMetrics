"""
This script was created to facilitate identification of undesired side effects
of updates related to the generation of target and Taylor diagrams using the
existing examples.

It supports the following argument as an option.

-clean_files : Delete new files if this flag is present

It can be invoked from a command line as:

$ python test_plots.py -clean_files

The script supports the argument "-h" for help (call "$ python test_plots.py -h").

The python scripts executed are those specified by SCRIPTS_TESTED below that
reside in the "Examples" folder. These scripts are executed without displaying
the plots but write new example graphics files. The new files are compared
pixel-wise with the previously existing example graphic files and a percentage
change is displayed for each example.

Percentage change: 100% * sum of pixel color differences / mean colors intensity

Some image files are generated with different width/height depending on the system.
When the size of the current image and the size of the new image are different,
both are resized to have the same size and then compared. This is reported in the
script output if it occurs.

Changes less than 2% may be considered negligible (GOOD). Between 2% and 10% should be
double checked (CHECK). More than 10% is a probable case of a difference arsing due to a
bug (BAD). The test_plot script reports these outcomes according to the percentage.
An example of the script output is shown below.

$ python3 test_plots.py
Executing 9 scripts in sequence:
 01:   0.86% distance between 'target1_example.png' and 'target1.png', GOOD.
 02:   0.15% distance between 'target2_example.png' and 'target2.png', GOOD.
 03:   0.15% distance between 'target3_example.png' and 'target3.png', GOOD.
 04:   0.00% distance between 'target4_example.png' and 'target4.png', GOOD.
 05:   0.00% distance between 'target5_example.png' and 'target5.png', GOOD.
 06:   0.11% distance between 'target6_example.png' and 'target6.png', GOOD.
 07:   0.00% distance between 'target7_example.png' and 'target7.png', GOOD.
 08:   2.64% distance between 'target8_example.png' and 'target8.png', CHECK (size adjusted).
 09:   2.48% distance between 'target9_example.png' and 'target9.png', CHECK (size adjusted).
New files were kept after comparison.


The list of scripts to be processed must be assigned to SCRIPTS_TESTED as a list of
tuples, and can make use of regular expressions (regex) for filename pattern
matching that is supported by the glob module. For example to process all
target and taylor scripts:

SCRIPTS_TESTED = ("target*[0-9].py", "taylor*[0-9].py")

To process only the target or taylor scripts:

SCRIPTS_TESTED = ("target*[0-9].py", ) # target diagrams only, must be a tuple

SCRIPTS_TESTED = ("taylor*[0-9].py", ) # Taylor diagrams only, must be a tuple

The list of files are processed in sorted alphabetical order.
