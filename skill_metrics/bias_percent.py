def bias_percent(predicted, reference):
    """
    Calculate the percentage bias (B) between two variables PREDICTED and
    REFERENCE (E'). The latter is calculated using the formula:

    BP = 100*(mean(p) - mean(r))/mean(r)

    where p is the predicted values, and r is the reference values.
    Note that p & r must have the same number of values.

    Input:
    PREDICTED : predicted field
    REFERENCE : reference field

    Output:
    B : bias between predicted and reference
