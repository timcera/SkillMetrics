def target_statistics(predicted, reference, field="", norm=False):
    """
    Calculates the statistics needed to create a target diagram as
    described in Jolliff et al. (2009) using the data provided in the
    predicted field (PREDICTED) and the reference field (REFERENCE).

    The statistics are returned in the STATS dictionary.

    If a dictionary is provided for PREDICTED or REFERENCE, then
    the name of the field must be supplied in FIELD.

    The function currently supports dictionaries, lists, and np.ndarray,
    types for the PREDICTED and REFERENCE variables.

    Input:
    PREDICTED : predicted field
    REFERENCE : reference field
    FIELD     : name of field to use in PREDICTED and REFERENCE dictionaries
                (optional)
    NORM      : logical flag specifying statistics are to be normalized
                with respect to standard deviation of reference field
                = True,  statistics are normalized
                = False, statistics are not normalized

    Output:
    STATS          : dictionary containing statistics
    STATS['bias']  : bias (B)
    STATS['crmsd'] : centered root-mean-square (RMS) differences (E')
    STATS['rmsd']  : total RMS difference (RMSD)

    Each of these outputs are one-dimensional with the same length.
